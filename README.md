## Problem Set 0

The firts CS50's problem was a Scratch Project, theme free, just to get used to programming logic.

My project was a game called **AVOID CORONA**, where you use your keyboard's arrows to move left and right, and jump, trying to avoid incomming virus.
You can find my full project on [Scratch Website](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/418053427)

## Problem Set 1

Here I have 3 exercises using progamming language C with simple functions.

### [hello.c](2020/PSET1/hello.c)

Just like anyother programming language, with C we started by creating a _Hello, World!_ code.
But the intention of this execise was testing the `get_string` function, a function used on CS50 course.
The program ask the user's name and print the phrase `hello, [user_name]`.

### [mario.c](2020/PSET1/mario.c)

Using the famous game "Mario Bros" as an inspiration this program ask the user to enter a height and creat a pyramid of # using the height input.

### [cash.c](2020/PSET1/cash.c)

On this problem we were told to build a coda using greedy algorithm. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a greedy algorithm is: 
> “one that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the overall, or globally, optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.”

Summarizing, the code was supposed to take a value of change and return how many coins a cashier would have to give to a client, using 0.25 (quarters), 0.10 (dimes), 0.05 (nickels), 0.01 (pennies), for coins values.
