# CS50 - GIOVANI KISZ

This repository contains my codes from the 2020 CS50x course.
This is a way of sharing my learning and my projects.


## Problem Set 1

Here I have 3 exercises using progamming language C with simple functions.

### [hello.c](2020/PSET1/hello.c)

Just like anyother programming language, with C we started by creating a _Hello, World!_ code.
But the intention of this execise was testing the `get_string` function, a function used on CS50 course.
The program ask the user's name and print the phrase `hello, [user_name]`.

### [mario.c](2020/PSET1/mario.c)

Using the famous game "Mario Bros" as an inspiration this program ask the user to enter a height and creat a pyramid of # using the height input.
